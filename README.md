# Flask Minimal Boilerplate
There doesn't seem to be any good, extremely minimal boilerplate for Flask projects. This fills that void. Note that there is
absolutely nothing other than a basic server and template pages, i.e. no additional packages and such. It's also heavily based
off of: https://github.com/realpython/flask-boilerplate, which effectively does this with a little more scaffolding in place.
